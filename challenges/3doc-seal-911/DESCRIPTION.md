You barely manage to get off bed as your phone rings. It's THAT ringtone: there's a call for you from the SEAL 911 white hat hotline.

The uber famous Safu DAO just realized that a sophisticated social engineering scheme allowed a hacker to gain access to the private key managing their centralized vault.

The Safu DAO's team incident response procedure is stuck in a bug that was introduced after the last rehearsal. The team shared the leaked key with you, hoping you can recover funds faster than the hacker. You are their last hope, the crypto world is watching. Go save them.

### WINNING CONDITION

Transfer all vault funds to the safe address.
